 Iris Flower Classification

1.Objective
This task focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species:
⦁	 Setosa
⦁	 Versicolor
⦁	 Virginica

    -using four features from the Iris dataset:
⦁	 Sepal length
⦁	 Sepal width
⦁	 Petal length
⦁	 Petal width

2.Tools Used
⦁  Python
⦁  NumPy, Pandas
⦁  Scikit-learn
⦁  Joblib

3. Models Used
⦁	StandardScaler
⦁	Logistic Regression (multinomial)

4.Files 
⦁ `notebook.ipynb`
⦁ `iris_dataset.csv` 
⦁ `iris_model.pkl`
⦁ `iris_summary.md` 

5.How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`notebook.ipynb`)
2. Run all cells in order
3. The notebook will display accuracy, a classification report, and confusion matrix

Conclusion
The model successfully learns the patterns in the Iris dataset and accurately classifies iris flowers into their correct species.
