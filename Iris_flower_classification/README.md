Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification

This task focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species:
⦁	 Setosa
⦁	 Versicolor
⦁	 Virginica

    -using four features from the Iris dataset:

⦁	 Sepal length
⦁	 Sepal width
⦁	 Petal length
⦁	 Petal width

Contents
⦁	 `notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the model code
⦁	 `iris_dataset.csv` — dataset used for training and testing
⦁	 `iris_model.pkl` — saved trained model
⦁	 `iris_summary.md` — summary of results

How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`notebook.ipynb`)
2. Run all cells in order
3. The notebook will display accuracy, a classification report, and confusion matrix

Tools Used
⦁	 Python
⦁	 NumPy, Pandas
⦁	 Scikit-learn
⦁	 Joblib

Result:
The Logistic Regression model achieves high accuracy on the Iris dataset.
